How To Use: Rebindable Input



Step 1:		Import the package. There should now be a few folders in different locations called "Rebindable Input".

Step 2:		Drag the "Rebindable Manager" prefab into your game's main scene. The prefab carries a script component that allows the entire system to work.
		Also, the script prevents the added prefab from being destroyed when loading different scenes.

Step 3:		Click on the just-added prefab, and look for the "Rebindable Data" script. This script allows the developer (you) to specify the default keybinds.

Step 4:		Define a few keys using the Inspector panel (such as Jump, Crouch, etc.) and a few axes (such as forward/backward, left/right, etc.) as your defaults.
		For keybinds, name it, set a key, and done! For axis binds, set a name, set a key that will return a positive result,
		and a key that returns a negative result, and done! You can even use up to 6 mouse buttons in your bindings!

Step 5A:	To determine if a keybind you defined is being pressed, you can use "RebindableInput.GetKey("NameOfBinding");" (returns true/false)
		where "NameOfBinding" is the name you specified for that binding earlier. This allows the developer to simply ask for, say,
		the Jump binding, and not have to worry about what key Jump actually uses.

Step 5B:	To get which direction an axis you defined is in, you can use "RebindableInput.GetAxis("NameOfBinding");" (returns 1, 0, or -1)
		where "NameOfBinding" is the name you specified for that binding earlier. This allows the developer to simply ask for, say,
		the Left/Right axis, and not have to worry about what keys Left and Right actually use.

Step 6:		To rebind mid-game, an example script has been provided that can be modified as needed, though it's recommended that it be backed-
		up for reference and then modified. Before manipulating input bindings inside the game, each script that wishes to do so must
		reference System.Collections.Generic	(JS: import System.Collections.Generic;	C#: using System.Collections.Generic;)



Available Scripts and Functions:

RebindableKey script  (C#):

	The RebindableKey script is the storage box for a single key binding. It contains a name string, and a KeyCode that will correspond to that name.
	This sript is designed to be used by the  rebinding system, and not for anything else, and in fact, is quite useless without said system.

	Variables:

		public string inputName;			The name of the key bind. Allows a developer to ask for an input by name, and not by key. Defaults to ""

		public KeyCode input;				The key for the key bind. This is checked against Unity's Input class. Defaults to KeyCode.A



RebndableAxis script (C#):

	The RebindableAxis script is the storage box for a single axis binding. It contains a name string, and 2 KeyCodes. If neither key is being pressed,
	0 will be returned. If only positive is being pressed, 1 will be returned. If only negative is being pressed, -1 will be returned. This is most
	useful for directions, as an example Forward/Back could be: "transform.forward * RebindableInput.GetAxis("NameOfAxis")" where positive is W and negative is S.

	This sript is designed to be used by the  rebinding system, and not for anything else, and in fact, is quite useless without said system.

	Variables:

		public string axisName;			The name of the axis bind. Allows a developer to ask for an axis by name, and not by key. Defaults to ""

		public KeyCode axisPos;			The key that results in 1 when pressed. This is checked against Unity's Input class. Defaults to KeyCode.W

		public KeyCode axisNeg;			The key that results in -1 when pressed. This is checked against Unity's Input class. Defaults to KeyCode.S



RebindableData script (C#):

	The RebindableData script manages all keybinds defined outside the game, and all rebinds performed inside the game.
	In-game rebinds are saved using Unity's PlayerPrefs class. For more info: http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html

	Functions:

		RebindableData GetRebindableManager ();		Gets an instance of the RebindableData class, so that other, non-static functions
								can be accessed.

		List<RebindableKey> GetCurrentKeys ();		Gets a list of the key binds that are currently in use by the system.

		List<RebindableAxis> GetCurrentAxes ();		Gets a list of the axis binds that are currently in use by the system.

		void ActivateDefaultKeys ();			Sets the active key binds in use by the system back to the default set in the editor.

		void ActivateDefaultAxes ();			Sets the active axis binds in use by the system back to the default set in the editor.

		void ActivateSavedKeys ();			Sets the active key binds in use by the system to previously saved, or default if no save is found.

		void ActivateSavedAxes ();			Sets the active axis binds in use by the system to previously saved, or default if no save is found.

		void SaveKeys ();				Saves the currently active list of keys.

		void SaveAxes ();				Saves the currently active list of axes.



RebindableInput script (JS/C#):

	The RebindableInput script provides access to functions that allow other scripts to check for keypresses by name, rather than by key.
	This script is written in both Javascript and C# for compatibility with scripts of both languages, since most scripts written in one language
	cannot access a script written in another. Thus, the developer doesn't have to rewrite a script in a new language to use Rebindable Input.
	This script is attached to the Rebindable Manager in both langauages in the event a developer has multiple input scripts in either language.

	Functions:

		bool GetKey (string inputName);			Returns true if the key corresponding to the given name is currently being pressed.
		function GetKey (inputName : String);		Throws a RebindableNotFoundException if a keybind with the given name is not found.

		bool GetKeyDown (string inputName);		Returns true for the very first frame the key corresponding to the given name is pressed,
		function GetKeyDown (inputName : String);	and will not return true until the key is released and pressed again.
								Throws a RebindableNotFoundException if a keybind with the given name is not found.

		bool GetKeyUp (string inputName);		Returns true for the very first frame the key corresponding to the given name is released,
		function GetKeyUp (inputName : String);		and will not return true until the key is pressed and released again.
								Throws a RebindableNotFoundException if a keybind with the given name is not found.

		int GetAxis (string axisName);			Returns 0 if no keys in the axis are pressed, 1 if positive is pressed, -1 if negative
		function GetAxis (axisName : String);		is pressed, and 0 again if both positive and negative is pressed.
								Throws a RebindableNotFoundException if a keybind with the given name is not found.

		KeyCode GetKeyFromBinding (string inputName);		Returns the KeyCode for the given keybind name.
		function GetKeyFromBinding (inputName : String);	Throws a RebindableNotFoundException if a keybind with the given name is not found.

		KeyCode GetPositiveFromAxis (string axisName);		Returns the KeyCode representing Positive for the give axis name.
		function GetPositiveFromAxis (axisName : String);	Throws a RebindableNotFoundException if a keybind with the given name is not found.

		KeyCode GetNegativeFromAxis (string axisName);		Returns the KeyCode representing Negative for the give axis name.
		function GetNegativeFromAxis (axisName : String);	Throws a RebindableNotFoundException if a keybind with the given name is not found.
